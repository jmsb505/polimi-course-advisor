    "reply": "That's great to hear! Video games can encompass a variety of topics within computer science and engineering, such as game development, graphics programming, artificial intelligence, and user experience design. \n\nTo help guide you further, it would be helpful to consider a few questions:\n\n1. **Specific Interests**: Are you more interested in the technical side of game development (like programming and graphics), or the design side (such as game mechanics and storytelling)?\n\n2. **Programming Languages**: Do you have any experience with programming languages commonly used in game development, such as C++, C#, or Python?\n\n3. **Workload and Format**: What kind of workload are you comfortable with? Do you prefer projects, exams, or a mix of both?\n\n4. **Collaboration**: Are you open to working in teams, or do you prefer to work independently?\n\n5. **Career Goals**: What kind of career are you aiming for in the gaming industry? Are you leaning towards development, design, or perhaps something like game testing or project management?\n\nThinking about these aspects can help narrow down the courses that would best suit your interests and career aspirations.",
